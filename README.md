# Advent of Code 2022 (over-engineered)
---
## Disclaimer
So, as a Java developer, this is my first time to work with only TypeScript code from scratch. Instead solving the AOC tasks urgently and any way, I will try to write perfect TS code. Sorry Santa, you'll be late if I am your soft-eng choice this year.
If you sneak into the project probably you will see very stupid and ugly lines or solutions. But, that is ok. Even more, you are invited to do a review and piss on my code as much as you want.

---
## Prerequisites
- Node.js (at least v18)
- VScode (mine is Ubuntu version 1.7.3)

---
## Setting the project
Just clone/checkout.
The data is stored in TXT files in ./inputs

---
## Run
`$ npm install`

`$ npm run start`

Use the CLI app.
